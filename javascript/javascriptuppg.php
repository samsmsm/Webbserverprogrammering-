<p id="demo"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ugandan Knuckles <br><br><br><br> About <br><br> Ugandan Knuckles is the nickname given to a depiction of the character Knuckles <br> from the Sonic franchise created by YouTuber Gregzilla, which is often used <br> as an avatar by players in the multiplayer game VRChat who repeat phrases like <br> “do you know the way” and memes associated with the country Uganda, most <br> notably the film Who Killed Captain Alex? and Zulul. The character is associated <br> with the expression “do you know the way”, which is typically spoken in a mock <br> African accent and phonetically spelled as “do you know de wey.”
<br><br>
Origin <br><br> On February 20th, 2017, YouTuber Gregzilla uploaded a review of the 2013 <br> platformer game Sonic Lost World, which featured a parody animation of the <br> character Knuckles (shown below, left). The video subsequently gave rise <br> to the Knuckles Sings remix series.</p>
